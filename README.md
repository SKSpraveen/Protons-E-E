## Libraries and Frameworks:–
##### • *React* :- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, React can be used for developing the front-end components of our web application. Its component-based architecture and virtual DOM makes it well-suited for creating interactive and responsive UIs. 
##### • *Node.js* :- As a server-side runtime environment, Node.js allows us to run JavaScript code on the server, enabling the development of scalable and efficient backend services. It provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it suitable for handling asynchronous operations. 
##### • *Express.js* :- A minimalist web framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities. It's lightweight and highly extensible, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs. 
##### • *MongoDB* :- A popular NoSQL database, MongoDB is known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. It stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON and supports features like sharding and replication, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data. 
 ##### • *Mongoose* :- A MongoDB object modeling tool designed for Node.js, Mongoose provides a straightforward way to work with MongoDB databases by providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data. It simplifies tasks such as validation, querying, and data manipulation.
